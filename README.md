# Is the Zika virus actually getting worse in the United States or is there false information out?

The following information was pulled directly from www.kaggle.com where there is a survey that shows the number of Zika cases per month and by location. Kaggle user, Thiago, created data visualizations that show Zika cases generally getting worse every year for every country.

However, Thiago’s generalizations give the audience a wrong impression and is not completely accurate. He is looking too broadly to see if the number of reported cases is increasing every year. He does not look to see if other factors could play a role, which creates a unwarranted fear among people. In addition, reported cases is not accurate as there could be those who feel that they have Zika viruses but are actually experiencing a different virus. If that is the case, the total number of reported cases does not get updated with the new number.

Instead we should be focusing on the number of confirmed cases so that we can be more accurate. We should also split up the data by age groups of 20 years, as shown in the survey. Age could play a critical role to see if Zika is getting worse and it will allow us to take more specific actions. Rather than scaring everyone and not being able to have a call-to-action, we could see if those who are younger tend to be more vulnerable than those who are older and vice-versa. Additionally we want to shift our focus to the United States as that information would affect us closely.

## Project Progression:

#### <i>Exploratory Visual:</i>
In the first visual, our goal is to see what the trend is between reported and confirmed case. In the graph we could see that there is generally a larger number of confirmed versus reported cases. It is interesting to see that in January there are a few reported cases but no confirmed cases. This could be an indicator that the symptoms could take a while to appear and the total number of confirmed cases that we see in June could be those who were actually affected in an early month such as February.

This is visual is good to see that we will need to take a closer look at the reported cases to see if it's actually increasing every month. From a high overview, it looks as though Zika is getting worse as the months progress. However, we still need to view additional factors such as age.
